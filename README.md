# my home on the internet...

hello, world!

no better time than now to start on a personal site! thinking of using this space as a portfolio site and perhaps a blog for any random thoughts. it would be nice to observe the development of my website-creation journey as well.

to-dos:
- start with an intro page
- add portfolio
- figure out how to make websites more interactive and fun (to me)!
- maybe also host comics...? :)
