# my home on the internet...

hello, world! the date is january 21, 2023.

no better time than now to start on a personal site! thinking of using this space as a portfolio site and perhaps a blog for any random thoughts. it would be nice to observe the development of my website-creation journey as well. to be honest, i'm a little scared of seeming completely incompetent at coding... but i'm more scared of not trying it at all. 

to-dos:
- start with an intro page
- add portfolio
- figure out how to make websites more interactive and fun (to me)!
- maybe also host comics...? :)
